# SPRINGS
A new method, SPRINGS (Sequence-based predictor of PRotein- protein interactING Site), is put forward which predicts if a residue in a given protein sequence is an protein-protein interaction site or not. The presented method has been implemented with the help of Neural Networks using sequence information alone. SPRINGS has been further benchmarked against other publicly available predictors.
# ABSTRACT
Knowledge of protein-protein interaction sites provides an important base for deciphering novel drug targets. But on account of biological complexity and transient forms, determination of these sites is a challenge in biology. Various computational approaches are being explored for relevant prediction based on available protein sequence-structure information. Here we propose a novel method SPRINGS (Sequence-based predictor of PRotein- protein InteractING Sites) for identification of interaction sites based on sequences. It uses protein evolutionary information, averaged cumulative hydropathy and predicted relative solvent accessibility from amino acid chains in artificial neural network architecture. The performance of SPRINGS is observed to be promising as a complementary approach for protein-protein interaction sites prediction in protein engineering and drug development.
